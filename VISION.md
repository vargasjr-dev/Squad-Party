# Squad Party Vision

## The Big Picture

**Squad Party is Mario Party for the mobile generation** — bringing the chaotic joy of competitive mini-games to friend groups wherever they are.

No console required. No couch required. Just your phone and your squad.

## The Problem

Party games have always been about gathering friends around a screen — but that screen used to be a TV. Today, everyone has a screen in their pocket, yet party gaming on mobile has been underwhelming: either shallow single-player experiences, or clunky ports that don't embrace the platform.

Meanwhile, the games that *do* work for groups (Jackbox, Mario Party) require everyone to be in the same room with dedicated hardware.

**What if the best party game platform was the one you already carry everywhere?**

## The Vision

Squad Party is built on three pillars:

### 1. Instant Competitive Fun

Quick rounds. Clear winners. Maximum chaos.

- **60-second bursts** — Perfect for any moment: waiting for food, killing time, or a dedicated game night
- **4-player sessions** — The sweet spot for competitive tension without overwhelming complexity
- **Real-time multiplayer** — See your friends react live as you steal first place

The goal: from "let's play" to actually playing in under 30 seconds.

### 2. Infinite Games Through AI Creation

This is where Squad Party becomes something new.

**Game Studio** lets anyone create custom mini-games by simply describing what they want:

> *"Make a trivia game about 90s movies"*
> *"Create a word game where you guess the word from emoji clues"*  
> *"I want a speed typing challenge with programming terms"*

Behind the scenes, AI (Claude) generates:
- Game metadata (name, rules, duration)
- Lua game logic that runs safely in a sandbox

**No coding required. Just imagination.**

This transforms Squad Party from a game into a *platform* — the library of games grows with every creative user.

### 3. Community-Driven Content

Games are organized into **Playlists** — curated collections that can be shared:

- **Platform Playlists** — Official, polished collections
- **My Playlists** — Personal favorites customized for your group
- **Community Playlists** — Discover what others have created

The best user-created games and playlists rise through play counts and ratings, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of content.

## The Experience

### For Players

1. Open the app, see active sessions your friends are hosting
2. Tap to join, wait in a lobby with Bitmoji avatars
3. Play through a playlist of 5-10 mini-games
4. Celebrate (or mourn) on the dramatic results screen
5. Play again or browse new playlists

### For Creators

1. Open Game Studio
2. Chat with AI: *"I want a game where players race to type song lyrics"*
3. AI generates the game — preview it instantly
4. Test with solo play, refine through conversation
5. Add to a playlist and share with friends (or the world)

## Design Philosophy

**Bold and Playful** — This isn't a productivity app. Every screen should feel like the party already started. Vibrant coral, electric yellow, dramatic animations.

**Competition Celebrated** — Rankings use dramatic scale and motion. First place feels like winning, not just completing.

**Mobile-Native** — Touch-first interactions. Quick gestures. No tiny buttons or desktop-era UI patterns.

**Personality Forward** — Bitmoji integration makes every player feel present. Your avatar celebrates when you win.

## Technical Foundation

- **Cross-Platform**: React Native (iOS, Android, Web)
- **Real-Time**: WebSocket multiplayer with optimistic updates
- **Extensible**: Lua sandbox for user-generated game logic
- **AI-Native**: Claude integration for conversational game creation

## The Future

As the platform grows:

- **Tournaments** — Scheduled competitive events with brackets
- **Seasons** — Limited-time playlists and challenges
- **Creator Tools** — More control for advanced game makers
- **Social Features** — Friends lists, crews, persistent rivalries
- **Spectator Mode** — Watch live sessions

## Success Looks Like

A group of friends scattered across three cities, playing a custom trivia game one of them made about inside jokes from college — laughing through their phones, connected through play.

That's Squad Party.
